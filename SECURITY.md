# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

- The impact you believe it has

You should receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours. Fixes will be released as soon as practical, and you will be credited in the release notes unless you prefer otherwise.
